                  Front-end development graduate of 2022 from Noroff -School of
                  technology and digital media. With this basic knowledge I want
                  to start a career in webdesign! With no prior experience in
                  the field I think the program has given me a lot of{" "}
                  <span>tools</span> and
                  <span>understanding</span> to build on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I desided after working as a vet tec and receptionist for 9
                  years, that I wanted to challenge myself and persue an
                  interest that had been linguring for quite some time:{" "}
                  <span>webdesign.</span> I choose the front-end studies as I am
                  both intrested in designing and coding so I wanted to get an
                  intruductury to both subjects.
                </p>
                {/* <p>
                  I must admit, I had no idea what I was getting myself into, as
                  I have zero experience prior and was a bit overwhelmed by the
                  scope of it all. But my <span>drive</span> and{" "}
                  <span>curiosity</span> got me through and I started to really
                  love it as I got more experience.

                {/* <p>As I progressed my interests leaned more to designing than coding</p> */}

                <span>Me</span> as a webdesigner
              </h2>
              <p>
                I love to <span>dig deep</span> in design choices and trends
                online to pick apart why and how some work and others don¬¥t, and
                see what I would do differently or use it as{" "}
                <span>inspiration</span> for my own design ideas. I see the
                importance of universal web design and aim to meet those
                standards. I try to <span>challenge myself</span> with different
                brands to expand my understanding of target audiences outside of
                my personal scope and experiences.
              </p>
              <p>
                I think some of the most <span>exiting</span> parts of webdesign
                is the everlasting evolution of technology and keeping up with
                trends, there is always something new to learn and test out!

                    important, make them feel welcome and included in the social
                    spectrum. I believe that if you feel as part of something
                    bigger you will go the extra mile to contribute and have
                    pride in your work.
